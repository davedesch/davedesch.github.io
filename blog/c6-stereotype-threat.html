    <h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>

<h5>Stereotype Threat in Tech</h5>

<h5>12-7-14</h5>

<p>This was a really hard blog for meal to write because there are so many mixed emotions when it comes to stereotypes. Especially because discussing race and minorities is a super touchy subject in our society.</p>

<p>Full disclaimer. I'm a completely average, middle class, white male, and I'm in my mid-twenties. It really doesn't get more "average" than that. Tech companies are filled to the brim that people that look exactly like me. I don't have to worry about a lot of things that other people have to worry about when it comes to stereotyping. I will never be able to fully comprehend what women and minorities go through when it comes to seeing themselves fitting into a culture that is currently dominated by people exactly like me.</p>

<p>What I really want to address is how I felt after doing the research. There is a lot of importance placed on increasing the number of women and minorities in the tech field. I fully support that, and I think it's really important. I think it's an absolute shame that many of these people think they're not good enough because they feel alienated by the culture. I want to let everyone in on a little secret...</p>

<p>Despite the fact that I may inherently have advantages because of my gender and the color of my skin, I still am scared as hell. I am struggling to learn code, just like everyone else. We are all in it together. When I read code, I can't tell what gender or race of person wrote it. I can only judge how well someone wrote something based on what I know. Computers don't care who you are, what you're about, or where you came from.</p>

<p>That's all I really feel comfortable saying in public. I could get into it longer but I feel like this is a conversation that is best brought into light, but discussed amongst individuals. It's easy for messages to get misinterpreted when put in a public forum. This is the internet after all. Basically, all I want to reiterate is that we are all in this together in the tech industry. I don't care who you are, what gender you are, what skin color you are, what your sexual orientation is, or anything else, as long as you're a good human being that's easy to work with and is willing to code. And that is about that.</p>
