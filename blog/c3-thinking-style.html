    <h3>Thinking Styles</h3>

<h5>Gregorc Thinking Style and Growth vs. Fixed Mindset</h5>

<h5>11-11-14</h5>

<p>A big part of being sucessful in both DBC and life is understanding your strengths and weaknesses. DBC has put a lot of emphasis on helping us understand the way we think and work. One test that helps determine or working and thinking styles is the Gregorc Thinking Style Test, developed by Anthony F. Gregorc, Ph. D. His test groups people into four different styles: Concrete Sequential, Concrete Random, Abstract Sequential, and Abstract Random.</p>

<p>All of these styles have pros and cons. I have found that I am predominantly Abstract Random and a little bit Concrete Random. But what does that mean?</p>

<p>Abstract Random people have a few positive and negative distinguishing traits. They are good listeners, great promoting group harmony, and work very well in personalized environments. They are not so good at dealing with authority, concentrating on one thing, and taking criticism.</p>

<p>Concrete random people excel at experimentation and taking risks. They learn best through trial and error and by working through problems. They fall short when it comes to showing how they got an answer, dealing with things that only have one answer, and dealing with restrictions.</p>

<p>The results I received explained a lot about my experience growing up and going through formal education. I have always had a problem showing my work on math problems. Sometimes, my mind moves so quickly and jumps around so randomly that I can arrive at answer before I can work everything out and show my work. This hurt me a lot in high school when you were docked points for not writing everything to show your work. Likewise, a personalized work environment is where I flourish. I am not good about sitting at an office and just doing work. I like to stand up, dance around, blare music, take lots of coffee breaks, and just mess around a lot when I am working. Even though I am time boxing, what I do on my breaks from coding may not be conducive to a more formal environment.</p>

<p>Learning how to overcome these shortcomings is how I plan to excel moving forward in my professional career. I believe that being able to identify the shortcomings and addressing them with a growth mindset is my greatest ally in becoming both a web developer and a better person overall.</p>

<p>There are two types of mindsets. A fixed mindset means you're afraid to take on new challenges and that you think your skill set is something you are born with. However, someone with a growth mindset thinks that everything in their life is adaptable. I know my shortcomings now thanks to the personality test. I also know that I can change my weaknesses through practice, resiliency, and discipline.</p>
