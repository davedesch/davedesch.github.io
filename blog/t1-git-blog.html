<h5>Cementing Concepts</h5>

<h5>10-31-14</h5>

<p>Growing up watching movies and tv I always saw a computer hacker or tech genius typing away at something then making the computer do magic things. I wondered what those programs were. Then Dev Bootcamp came along. The curriculum introduced me to a few programs that were more powerful than I could have ever imagined. After a few weeks of practice I feel fairly comfortable using, and explaining some of the programs we use and the commands we input to use them. These programs include Git, GitHub, and my personal favorite, Terminal.</p>

<p>A command line interface is a text based input program that allows you to make every change you could think of to your computer. Terminal is the Command Line Interface native to Mac computers. It's a complete workhorse, and a solid understanding of how to navigate the terminal will change how you use your computer forever. It is the key to quickly and efficiently balance all of the other programs and tools I will mention later in this blog. Terminal does it all. I can add and remove files, create pathways, upload changes to Git, open sublime, download changes from repositories on git, and probably order pizza (not sure if it can really do that, but I will be sure to look into it). Knowing the right terminal shortcuts can get you controlling your computer almost immediately. Seriously. If you're on a mac search for Terminal in spotlight. Open terminal, it's a plain white rectangle that doesn't look like much. Type "echo Hello World!" then press return. Boom. You're operating the terminal.</p>

<p>The terminal isn't the only thing you'll solely be using. In fact, it just facilitates easy utilization of all the other tools you'll be using. Most importantly are Git, a type of Version Control Software, and GitHub, the social network in which all changes are documented and approved and you can connect and collaborate with colleagues all around the world in an instant.</p>

<p>Version control software is very important in programming. Imagine spending a really long time writing a paper for a group project. You finish a majority of the paper and give it to one of your group partners to finish. Your group partner writes some things, but also irrevocably deletes a majority of what you just wrote! You're screwed and just wasted all that time. Git would never let that happen. With Git everyone has the same copy of the original paper, and they can all make modifications as they see fit, without changing the original article! Only after all the rewritten papers are combined does the group collectively combine the changes they like and omit or discard the things they didn't like about the paper. That makes life really easy!</p>

<p>However, git is a big ugly scary simple looking program. I'm not a computer genius and I don't know what half the git things are doing in the terminal or what the messages mean. I don't know how to find collaborators. I need a nice, user-friendly, social network in which I can collaborate on git easily. That's GitHub. GitHub allows you to make repositories of all your projects and find collaboraters online to work with. When anything is pushed from git (via the all important Terminal) it shows up on your GitHub. Through GitHub you can visually see the changes and who made them and combine things in a much more user-friendly environment than just the terminal. Plus, everything is safe! Nothing can be deleted unless it is explicitly told to be delted by someone who is in charge of the project. It's much safer to store your code there than on a local computer or just with one copy which is susceptible to deletion, unauthorized changes, or just random bad computer things that can mess everything up.</p>

<p>With all of these programs working in harmony with one another the workflow for coding is surprisingly easy, efficient, and fun. The secret is to study and learn all the shortcuts for both Terminal and Git. Once you understand the more complicated concepts of cloning, fetching, pulling, pushd, popd, grep, and countless others it becomes super easy to use. Projects that you would think would take countless hours don't take nearly that long. All because you have awesome tool at your disposal. Some are even on your computer right now! Check them out and give them a try.</p>
