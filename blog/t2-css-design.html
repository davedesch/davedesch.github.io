<h5>Explaining Borders, Margins, and Padding</h5>

<h5>11-9-14</h5>

<p>Are you familiar with CSS? If not, allow me to explain. CSS was created to be as complicated as possible and give DBC students nightmares in their second week of Phase 0.</p>

<p>Okay, maybe it's really not that bad. But it does take some time to understand.</p>

<p>Basically, CSS organizes everything into blocks. These blocks can be manipulated through code. Everything from the font family and size, to the positioning on the screen and headers and footers can be created. One of the biggest parts in understanding how to place things correctly is to understand how certain blocks are organized.</p>

</p>Blocks have three elements: the margin, border, and padding. Think of these as a series of layers. The outermost layer is the margin. The margin does not directly affect the the content. Rather, it determines the spacing between other blocks in the document. You can make these margins as big or as small as you'd like in order to space things to your liking.</p>

<p>The border is an area around the content. The box that your content is in already has a fixed size. The border starts at the outermost line of pixels and can become as big or as small as you want, but it starts from the outermost line of pixels and works its way inward. That way it does not interfere with the margin that is located directly on the outside of the box.</p>

<p>Padding is the innermost layer. Padding determines the spacing between elements in the content. For example, if you're making a navigation bar you may have several links in an unordered list. The padding can determine the spacing between these links. You would not use margin or border because they are all in the same box. Padding will space out these links to your liking.</p>

<p>Of course, CSS is never as simple as it sounds. But through hours and hours and hours of practice you will start to get the hang of it. A good grasp of CSS will make your HTML websites beautiful!</p>
