    <h3>Questions</h3>

<h5>Asking better questions to get better answers</h5>

<h5>1-11-15</h5>

<p>Asking the right question is crucial in programming. Preferred languages and operations are always changing, so it's up to us as programmers to constantly be learning. There isn't really a school that can teach you everything you need to know. Even if there was, you would have to continue to attend that school forever due to the ever changing landscape. Therefore, good programmers are always in a state of self-teaching.</p>

<p>Self-teaching means that you are going to encounter a lot of things that you don't know and you're going to have to figure out for yourself. Luckily, our community as a whole is pretty good about helping everyone out and sharing their knowledge with those eager and willing to learn. Websites like Quora and StackOverflow are goldmines in terms of learning new things and having questions answered. If you've ever encountered a problem there's a very very good chance that someone else has also had that problem and has asked about it online. A huge part of asking a good question is making sure that it hasn't been answered before.</p>

<p>For example, if I was to ask "In Ruby, what's the difference between an integer and a float?" that would be a terrible question to ask. Why? Because I can guarantee with 100% certainty that it's already been answered somewhere online. Before reaching out to the community, making sure that your question isn't elsewhere will help you get much better answers.</p>

<p>I've asked one question on the 2015 Squirrels GooglePlus community. I was having trouble figuring out why whenever I was running rspec on my solution file for some of our Ruby challenges that it was returning 0 examples and 0 failures. I posted to the community saying pretty much exactly what I just said here. I also included a screen shot of the problem so other people in my cohort could see exactly what was going wrong. Within about 15 minutes I had a working solution (run rspec on the spec file not the my_solution file).</p>

<p>I think this was a fairly effective method. One good thing that Google Plus has going for it is the ability to post pictures and screenshots of what is going wrong. However, after reading some of the prompts for this blog post I realize I could have done a better job of asking the question. Had I asked the same question in StackOverflow they would have had no idea what I was talking about and because there is no ability to post a screenshot they wouldn't have even been able to see what I was doing wrong.</p>

<p>This makes me realize there is a better way to ask the question. I could have specified that this was a Ruby problem that I was encountering in the terminal. That I was trying to run rspec on a file, and that there were multiple files associated with said challenge. Had I done that, someone probably could have figured out what I was doing wrong and let me know.</p>

<p>I've noticed that most of the problems having to do with coding on StackOverflow includes code itself. That way people can try to get to the bottom of the problem and even play around with the code on their computer. I think this is very effective if you describe what you're having trouble with.</p>

<p>Asking a good question can be a hard proposition. You just have to learn to be concise and succinct. Snooping around on the internet for potential answers is a very good way to get started before asking the question yourself. Also, ask a lot of questions every day. The more you practice asking questions, the better you become at asking questions. Just like everything else we do.</p>
