    <h3>Feeback and Pairing</h3>

<h5>Emotions in Feedback and Pair Programming</h5>

<h5>12-1-14</h5>

<p>Pair Programming is equal parts wonderful and scary. I love pair programming because I know that most of the time I will be able to complete a challenge much quicker than I would be able to do myself. I also think that pairing can be very intimidating and overwhelming. A lot of the people I have paired with have been way beyond me in terms of their understanding of the concepts we are attempting to learn. When that happens I am afraid that there is nothing I can contribute to the challenge and that I will be a burden to the pairing because my partner will spend most of their time teaching me things and not be able to work through the problem as quickly and efficiently as he or she may like.</p>

<p>I have that fear a lot, but the fear is almost immediately gone as soon as I start programming with someone. Most of the time it's a fun and equally collaborative outing. No matter how much anyone knows, there are always things they don't know. I have had sessions where the person seemed way beyond me, but I knew some parts really well that they weren't familiar with at all. We both end up teaching each other things and become stronger programmers as a result. That's always a good feeling.</p>

<p>The best part of pair programming is that most of the things I've learned so far in Phase 0 I learned or refined in pair programming sessions. Having the opportunity to work with people and explain things as a navigator was good at making concept sticks, as well as driving and seeing how our navigator would do things. It's pretty incredible really.</p>

<p>But after the Pair Programming comes the feedback. Which is equally nerve wracking. At the end of the day, the people you are working with are evaluating you, and you are going to get to read it, albeit anonymously.</p>

<p>Checking your feedback is kind of like checking your bank account after a night of excessive partying. You are afraid to do it, but you have to check it out to see how you are doing and how your behavior needs to be going forward.</p>

<p>The feedback is important to my learning. The thing that I'm most concerned about first and foremost is making sure that I was kind and easy to work with and respectful of others. Even if you have no idea what you're doing, if you're kind and respectful to the other person it means they will be more willing to help you and more understanding. People are more willing to work with you if you're easy to get a long with. No one wants to work with a programming genius who is a complete jerk and isn't good with other people.</p>

<p>Writing and reading feedback is kind of weird though. It's good to see where people could think you could use improvement. I still feel like our classmates are afraid to say how they really feel. A majority of what I have read talks about how great the pair was, then inserts a small little critique, and then talks about how great everything is again.</p>

<p>I attribute this to two factors. First, we are all new to both pairing and writing feedback. We don't want to hurt each other's feelings because we don't want our feelings to be hurt. Second, since we are so new most of our challenges are us learning new things together and maybe not true pair programming in a sense. I have a feeling once we have a lot more experiencing in pairing and have worked with many more people we will have a better sense of what works and what doesn't in a pairing session and be able to critique more effectively. You don't know what a "just okay" pairing session is until you've had a truly great paring session. I think time and experience will make giving and receiving feedback a lot more efficient.</p>
