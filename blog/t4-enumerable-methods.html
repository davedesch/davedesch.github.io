    <h3>Map</h3>

<h5>Understanding Map (Why it's way better than Each!)</h5>

<h5>11-18-2014</h5>

<p>Getting Ruby to do things can be big ugly business when you're just starting out (even though they can be big and ugly when you're experienced as well). One of the most useful things to know when you're starting out is how to do things using the each method. The each method works by taking something like an array, which I explained in my previous blog, and telling it that for each instance you should do something. </p>

<p>For example if I have an array of [1, 2, 3] (let's call it array1) and I tell Ruby Array1.each do {|x| x + 1} Ruby will go through and add 1 to every integer in the array. We can then create a new array and push changes to it so it will return [2, 3, 4].</p>

<p>That's super great and useful, but we can also save a step while doing that. That's when the .map method comes in handy! Map works a lot like .each. As a matter of fact, it took me almost a week to figure out it was something different than each. Each and Map are related kind of the same way .size, .length, and .count are related. The seem like they can be used almost interchangeably and still serve the same purpose. While they are close, .map and .each serve two very different purposes.</p>

<p>The secret to .map is that it will create a new array that has already made the changes for you. In the previous example, when we used .each we had to explicitly create a new array in order to see the changes that we just made. With .map the output and result of calling the map method is a brand new array that has already done everything for you.</p>

<p>Using the same example as .each, if we did array1.map {|x| x +1} and asked for it to show what array 1 was, it would now return [2, 3, 4]. </p>

<p>This can save significant time, especially in refactoring. When you refactor your code you will find if you have a bunch of methods you can all done them in succession by dividing them only with periods. By doing something like array1.map{|x| x+ 1}.to_s.reverse.count we can put everything in our initial code that was on multiple lines and do it all in one short and sweet beautiful line. Map is great because it saves us a step and makes our results easier to put all together in one.</p>
