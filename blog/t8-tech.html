    <h3>Ruby on Rails</h3>

<h5>So... What Exactly is Rails?</h5>

<h5>1-1-15</h5>

<p>What is Rails?</p>

<p>It's already week 8 of DBC Phase 0. I have learned so much. I know a lot more than I did about Ruby, I've learned some JavaScript, I taught myself some HTML, and I've discovered that CSS is the devil. What I haven't exactly learned is "what is rails?" We've done a lot of stuff with Ruby, which I think is awesome. And when researching and signing up for DBC and read a lot of articles and research that said "learn Ruby on Rails, it's the best thing to learn right now... everyone is using it!" So I took those reviews and conversations to heart. I signed up for DBC knowing more that I like computers and coding and puzzles and solving problems, but not really knowing what Rails was exactly.</p>


<p>8 weeks into prep and we still haven't explicitly defined what rails is. I guess now is probably a good time to start.</p>


<p>My initial understanding of Ruby on Rails is that it is a framework. That is something that is emphasized over and over by anyone that knows about it. It's a framework that uses the Ruby programming language to create web-driven apps and sites. This framework allows for the creator to not worry about the low-level details of what goes into creating a website because rails already takes care of it for you. This allows creators to be super efficient and allows them to do in a few hours what would have taken a couple days of coding.</p>


<p>What I took away from my research is that Ruby on Rails is super efficient because it combines Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS into one easy to use package. All of these different components coalesce to make websites applications.</p>


<p>Another important aspect of Ruby is that in addition to being a useful tool, it's also a community. This Rails community is predicated on shared values that all users try to follow. Some traits that pop up most often are "convention over configuration" and DRY methods (don't repeat yourself). Not repeating yourself makes code easier to read, more concise, and more efficient for big projects. Convention over configuration is a philosophy that tries to reduce the amount of decisions that developers need to make. By standardizing a lot of a lot of code developers can still be creative and try and create new things, but they also aren't going way off the deep end and creating things that no one else can understand. All developers learn the same standards and ideas and build upon them.</p>


 <p>The stack provided by Rails has been curated by people who have poured their heart and soul into creating an efficient way to create web applications. Their decisions may not be suitable for everyone, and some of the constraints might make people shy away from using it if they want carte blanche control over every aspect of deploying a website. But for creating an app and utilizing JavaScript, Ruby, HTML, and CSS, Rails is a great tool used by thousands of people to create awesome and meaningful things in a short period of time. Basically, everything that I've learned in my past 8 weeks will all be used together when utilized by Rails. That's why we've been learning everything we've been learning, and that's what Rails is.</p>
