    <h3>Conflicts</h3>

<h5>Diffusing Concepts Makes Everyone Happier</h5>

<h5>1-1-15</h5>

<p>Conflicts in life are inevitable. When you're dealing with multiple people, with multiple opinions, disagreements in a way to do things are inevitable. They arise every day. It can be something as simple as dishwasher etiquette in the kitchen, or as complicated as implementing a major project and how to go about things. Learning how to effectively diffuse situations is a major skill to have.</p>

<p>I think one of the most important conflicts I've had to overcome is my first time living with my new roommates. We were all still adjusting to how everyone operates. We all do our own things, but we are also close friends that try our best to respect each other. We spend a lot of time together in our living room. It's our communal living area. Because it is communal we are all there a lot and we all have to put up with each other. I work nights. I get home very late. When I get home, I like to get home and make a snack and watch TV and decompress. Since all of this goes down at about 1 or 2 in the morning, it typically involves me passing out and leaving all of my dishes on the table.</p>

<p>Every morning I like to get up and put all my dishes away and clean the living and start the day with a clean living space. However, my mornings seem to be a little later than my roommates. If I go to bed at 2 or 3, I get up between 9 and 11am. Sometimes my roommates are early risers. They're up at 630 or 7am. Because of this, they were waking up to dirty dishes or trash on the coffee table. I got called out on it, and not in a way that I appreciate.</p>

<p>The way that my roommates approached me about it initially was probably not the best way. It's definitely not appropriate to publish what they said verbatim. It made me angry. My initial emotion was anger and rage. I felt that I was being called out for something that we all did. There were countless weekend nights where my rooommates would go out and leave things out and dirty that I would just clean without mentioning. I felt when they took the initiative to clean they had to let me know all about it, but when I did I didn't say anything.</p>

<p>This was a major conflict. We almost came to blows. But we figured it out.</p>

<p>After a settling down period and taking time away from the situation so all parties could cool down I explained my position calmly and in detail. I also brought up things that they did that bothered me. In order to more effectively live together we aired out all of our problems and set ground rules to how the living room would be handled. Now, all dishes and empty cans have to at least make it to the dishwasher and recycling. This goes for everyone, on any night, no matter the situation. Anyone who doesn't follow the protocol is held accountable.</p>

<p>Two things came from this. First, I modified my routine to add steps to make everyone happy, my rooommates also altered their routines. Adding small steps to the routine wasn't as hard as I initially expected, my roommates found it pretty easy as well. Second, we all realized that if we calmly sit down and address problems as soon as they arise there isn't a situation that spins out of control because all parties have been bottling their emotions in. Getting things off your chest before they boil over is a much better way of going about things.</p>

<p>I learned that being assertive and calmly explaining your emotions helps a lot more in the long run than being passive aggressive. Now we all have fun with clearly set boundaries and expectations. And we also have a lot of fun calling out certain roommates when they don't follow the agreement after a long night of partying, but we don't hold it against them too much because we realize that everyone is human and makes mistakes sometimes.</p>
