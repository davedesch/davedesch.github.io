    <h3>What am I made of?</h3>

<h5>Reflecting on my Values</h5>

<h5>12-15-14</h5>

<p>There are so many values that I think are important. I chose to dwell on reputation because I believe it is one of the most important values. Reputation can encompass a variety of other values. Your reputation can determine the values that you excel at and the values you need to work on. I take great pride in someone coming to me for something and knowing they have nothing to worry about because of my reputation. If someone needs a job done, my reputation says that I will get it done for them. I am grateful that my commitment to values shines through and other people recognize it.</p>

<p>My reputation definitely showed when I have friends and coworkers approaching me to ask about furthering their own educational careers. They have seen how hard I have worked and studied for this adventure that I'm taking at DBC and have sought me out to give them advice on whether or not they should learn to code or pursue other avenues in their careers. Although I haven't really accomplished anything yet, the fact that they recognize that I'm a hard worker and making something of myself makes me feel that I must be doing something right. They may think that I'm smarter and I am more put together than I actually am, but the fact that they think that may mean that I'm not giving myself enough credit.</p>

<p>I feel that a lot of time people don't recognize how strong their values actually are. Sometimes others recognizing them in you can give you a much better perspective on how you are developing as a person. This can come in especially handy when you are faced with Stereotype Threat. Feelings of inadequacy and other challenges associated with Stereotype Threat can be ameliorated by having a strong understanding of your strengths and weaknesses when it comes to your values.</p>

<p>Just because you may feel inadequate, doesn't mean that you are. Recognizing what you're good at and what you can improve on is an amazing tool. It can help you overcome some of your fear by reminding yourself that you do have the resources and facilities to overcome challenges either real or imagined by your mind. By understanding your values and reputation you can be a lot stronger of human being just by simply being aware of what you're really made of.</p>
