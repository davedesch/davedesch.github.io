    <h3>Hashes vs. Arrays</h3>

<h5>Understanding Organizing with Integers and Key-Value Pairs</h5>

<h5>11-11-2014</h5>

<p>In Ruby, it's very important to keep things nice and orderly.  Almost everything you deal with while coding is put into an array or a hash because almost everything is going to come in a list. For all data there are things numbers, details, words that come in lists. Things like address books, email, and your music library are just very complex lists. All these lists can be sorted in an orderly fashion and manipulated using hashes and arrays.</p>

<p>There is a big fundamental difference between hashes and arrays. Arrays are, in my opinion, the most basic. They organize things based on a fixed integer value. For example, take the following array: array1 = ["one", "two", "three"]. This array is sorted by integers. For example, if you wanted to get the "two" in your array you would use array[1]. Nothing can ever identify the second element in your array besides [1], it will always be ordered in a list with an integer value assigned to it.</p>

<p>It's important to note that in Arrays your first value always starts at 0. This can be confusing. I remember it by thinking when I was born my first year of life I was 0, my second year of life I was 1.</p>

<p>Arrays are denoted with these nice little square brackets, [ ].</p>

<p>Hashes give you a little more flexibility than an array. They will always store objects in a pair, which is the key and value, respectively. The keys and values can be almost anything! This is particularly useful for things like inputting an address. If you were trying to organize a group of addresses to a list you could assign a key value to something like the state where something is. Here's an example.</p>

<p>hash1 = { "state" => "California" }</p>

<p>In Hash1 your key is "state" and your value is "California". There are so many uses for key-value pairs. Anything that you can think of that you wouldn't want to describe with an integer you can call something else with a hash. All hashes use braces, they look like this: { }. </p>

<p>Here's another example of hashes, NFL teams! I made the key the city, and the value the team name. </p>

<p>nfl_teams = { "Detroit" => "Lions", "San Francisco" => "49ers", "Chicago" => "The Worst Team Ever aka Bears"}.</p>

<p>Hashes will give you much more flexibility than an array, even if the pairs in the hash weren't in the order they are in now, I could still call "Detroit" and get "Lions". With an array, if things are explicitly changed, whatever order they're in is the integer they're assigned.</p>
