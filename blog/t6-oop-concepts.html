    <h3>Ruby Classes</h3>

<h5>Classes: What, When, Why, How</h5>

<h5>12-7-14</h5>

<p>Object Oriented programming has been heavily emphasized in DBC. One of the most important resources that boots will have throughout the duration of the course is POODR,  Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby. I have been through over 6 weeks of DBC and this week was the first time I've ever heard about Functional Programming.</p>

<p>I originally thought that object oriented programming was just programming and there was no other way to do it. I couldn't be father from the truth. If you google Object Oriented vs Functional Programming you will find countless results that weight e pros and cons of each approach to programming. What I have gathered from my research is that each has pros and cons.</p>

<p>Object Oriented programming revolves around objects. Objects may be well defined with great built in method to alter them. However, this object may not be visible to the public eye, and since it is already defined, you may run into problems when trying to alter it more because it relies on its original definition before you change everything.</p>

<p>Conversely, when you have functional programming nothing is defined. If you want to do something new you just simply write something that is functional and manipulate it to your needs. There is no need to rely on a defined object to reach your objectives in the code. This can be very helpful if you're tackling a problem and you don't want to get hung up on something you're trying to code.</p>

<p>However, I am more of a fan of knowing what an object is and trying to come up with brilliant and logical ways to change it based on the definition that it has already been given.</p>

<p>I want to fully disclose that I am a complete amateur just getting a basic grasp of the two varying schools of thought on programming. I wish I knew more of the intricacies and differences in the two, but I don't. I believe truly understanding the difference comes from writing countless lines of code rather than trying to explain it.</p>
