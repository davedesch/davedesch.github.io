    <h3>Ruby Classes</h3>

<h5>Classes: What, When, Why, How</h5>

<h5>12-1-14</h5>

<p>So what are classes?</p>

<p>That's what I was asking myself at the beginning of this week. The idea itself can be pretty abstract. A lot of people spend so much time just trying to figure out how to get things to work correctly in Ruby with iteration, strings, integers, floats, and everything else that adding another layer can become very confusing. I will attempt to clarify what I've gathered from my week of intensive work and research.</p>

<p>There are already "built in" classes in Ruby. You've seen them before. They are strings, floats, integers, arrays, etc. We know that when we want to make everything capitalized in a string we can call "string.upcase". In that example the string is our class and upcase is a method that will make every letter in the string uppercase.</p>

<p>However, when writing in ruby there are literally an infinite amount of things that you might need to define that don't have a class. So we create one. With that class we can create any methods we would need to change that class.</p>

<p>Don't worry. It starts to get clearer.</p>

<p>Gabe Newell described the computer as "the dumbest thing in the world", and it's true. I can tell the computer that there is something called a Television, but it has NO IDEA what the heck a television is. So instead we have to tell our program that there is something called a television and use methods to do things that a television do.

<p>So if Television is our new class, what would we want to do with a television? Well I would want to be able to turn it on and off, change volume, change channels, and change the HDMI input so I can switch from my Apple TV to PS4.</p>

<p>Each one of those characteristics in a class would get a method. These individual methods would tell ruby everything you need to know about the Television. With our first method, on, we could set the method to a boolean, and our other methods could only work if our TV is on by making sure the @on == true.</p>

<p>These methods can now be utilized in our class i.e. Television.change_channel the same we we do string.upcase. They are both classes being modified by method. The only difference is now WE are the ones creating the classes methods vs the built in methods for the built in classes we were using in our previous learning.</p>
