<h5>Differences between JavaScript and Ruby</h5>

<h5>12-15-14</h5>

<p>Learning Ruby is really hard. I've been at it for months and I still am just getting an idea of how everything works. So seeing that this week I wouldn't be using Ruby and instead learning JavaScript I had some initial anxiety. To my relief JavaScript and Ruby have a lot of similarities. I learned that having a decent foundation in one language makes acquiring other languages much easier. Understanding basic concepts in Object Oriented programming leaves you to understand what you're doing when you break down the problem. They key is to learn the nuances of the new language and getting formatting and operations correct. But translating is a lot easier than learning what everything is in the first places!</p>

<p>There are a few key differences between Ruby and JavaScript. Most notably, Ruby makes everything REALLY easy. JavaScript is a lot more "dumb" than Ruby. With JavaScript you have to be a lot more explicit in your coding. While there are many ways to do something in Ruby, in JavaScript there is often only one correct way of doing things.</p>

<p>I think it is demonstrating in outputting things to terminal. With Ruby we have a variety of options, you can "return", use a "puts" or "prints" statement, you can even just use a "p". With JavaScript, not so much. Do you want something to be output from the terminal? You have one option, console.log. I actually prefer this! Sometimes I get confused as to whether or not I should use a puts or print.</p>

<p>Hashes and Objects are pretty similar as well. In Ruby, a hash is assigned to a key value pair. JavaScript objects work the same way. In JavaScript, if you have a variable named "person" you can give it certain traits and characteristics. For instance, in var person, you can have "name: "Dave" then person.name would have the value of "Dave". It's the same way as a hash in ruby can have a Key of "Name" and a value of "Dave". I personally think it's a little easier in JavaScript because it's a lot easier to call variable.name instead of a ruby hash.</p>

<p>My biggest in all of coding is wrapping my head around loops. Loops and iteration has always been a challenge for me. Luckily, JavaScript operates a lot like Ruby as well. The concept is the same. You assign a counter a value. You have the counter stop counting when it meets a certain condition. And you increase or decrease the value of your counter to meet that condition. The key difference in ruby is that your counter function would be something like for (i = 0, i < 11, i++). The i++ is what threw me the most. It is basically the same as i += 1. It's those nuances in Ruby, just like the use of brackets and syntax, that takes a little time to understand. But for the most part, they're very similar and translate easily after a little bit of studying. </p>
