    <h3>The Biggest Challenge in Tech</h3>

<h5>Impostor Syndrome in Tech</h5>

<h5>11-18-14</h5>

<p>For this weeks blog my lovely cohort, the Squirrels, were assigned to write about something we thought was a big problem facing the tech world. I am willing to bet good money that a lot of my fellow cohort-mates wrote about the lack of women in the tech industry. I agree that this is a big problem, but I think one of the major deterrents for women getting into tech applies to all people. In my months of prep and 3+ weeks of being in actual Phase 0 I, an average white male, have suffered from this deterrent as well. I am referring to what people are calling "Impostor Syndrome", and it has affected me deeply.</p>

<p>Impostor Syndrome is when you feel like an impostor relative to the people you're around. It is what makes you feel like you're not good enough or smart enough to do the thing you're actually doing. While this applies to all hobbies and professions, I think it's exasperated in the tech industry.</p>

<p>There has always been special reverence given to software engineers. They are regarded as the best and the brightest. Kids who go to work for Google and Facebook are basically rockstars amongst other twenty-somethings who are stuck in dead-end jobs. They are seen as the ones who are smart enough to get good benefits and a livable salary. When software engineers are the new rockstars you have a giant barrier of entry when you think you might want to do it too.</p>

<p>The experts all say "anyone can learn to code", but when you are facing constant uncertainty and fear it sure doesn't seem like it. I personally have spent countless hours on exercise 5 this week and am still not getting it 100%. I feel like I'm going to get kicked out of DBC because everyone else seems to be able to do it effortlessly. When you spend your time away from your "real" job getting error message after error message you start to doubt if you're actually cut out for what your'e going for.</p>

<p>If people feel like they don't really belong they might not stick to it and actually learn to code. Women feel especially at a disadvantage because they don't see a lot of women in the industry in the first place. When people tackle a new, and especially hard new challenge, the feeling that they don't belong can deter them from sticking with it and making a difference.</p>
