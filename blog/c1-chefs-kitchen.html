<h5>Managing Expectations for Dev Bootcamp</h5>

<h5>10-31-14</h5>

<p>The DBC experience is an experience that you've never experienced before in your life. It took me a really long time to manage my expectations for school in both high school and colllege. Every semester I wanted to be a straight-A student. Somehow, through the long tenuous drage of classes and lectures and assignments, along with balanceing the school workload and work itself, I failed. I never was a perfect 4.0 student (though I got close on a few occasions!). Something happens to you over the course of a really long term. This is why I am so excited about the DBC experience. For 9 weeks onsite I am expected to put forth the best and most intense effor I have ever put into anything in my life. This seems very managable. Not only because it is a relatively short time to give it your all, but because literally everyone else you are surrounding yourself has the same goal.</p>

<p>I believe everyone motivated to do their best work ever working together will pusbh me farther than I've ever been pushed, and I think this is the heart and my overall impression of the DBC experience. Nothing is going to be easy, but we don't need it to be easy if we can all put our collective minds together and help each other achieve exceptionalism.</p>

<p>What I took most from Shereef's fireside chat is when he said, "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together." I came into Dev Bootcamp with the mindset that I will work hard to be the best damn programmer DBC has ever seen! That's how I always operate, that's what motivates me to put forth the best effort. After watching the video, I now have the mindset that the SF Squirrels 2015 will be the best damn cohort DBC has ever seen! We are all in this together and through pushing each other and assisting each other we can accomplish things that we would not be able to do solely by going alone.</p>

<p>A lot of people attend DBC for a variety of reasons. One of the biggest reasons is that learning coding on our own wasn't doing the trick for us. Most people attend because they wanted to be an environment that is somewhat guided and there is a lot of assistance. The instructors are definitely world class, but we also will be teaching ourselves a lot after 6pm when the instructors go home and in our peer programming sessions.</p>

<p>My expectations of DBC remain the same. I think It will be one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life. I look forward to my Cohort pushing me and helping me in ways that my classmates in college never did. I also look forward to helping my cohort in any way that I can. Yes, it makes me nervous. Any challenge this big to change your life will make you nervous, especially with the time and financial commitment, but it's a good nervous energy. Having no other options and a good support system always seems to bring out the best in me. Now it's time to put that nervous energy to good use!</p>
